<h1>A solution of the header-implementation dependency problem</h1>

<p>For a long time, I have used the Code::Blocks IDE to develop some smaller C++ projects, but I have always thought it is too much effort to create a project just for playing with an example. However, the project will possibly grow, and then the IDE was necessary to maintain all dependencies.</p>

<p>To get a way with the problem of growing projects and the threshold in creating new project, I decided last summer to build an automated build tool for C++. Out of this project came two things: A new class library, called <a href="gabi/html/namespace_herbs.html">Herbs</a>, and the build tool <a href="gabi/html/utils.html">Wand</a> itself. Together, I decided to call the entire project <a href="gabi">Gabi</a> Application Building toolkIt, Gabi being the magic Fae who uses her Wand to compile all projects.</p>

<p>When I designed Wand, I realised that the best solution to the dependency problem is that all files in a project should declare themselves. What needs to be known about a target is</p>

<ul>
<li>The target filename</li>
<li>The target dependencies</li>
<li>Which source file to use on specific platforms</li>
</ul>

<p>By adding this information to each source file, and adding dependencies for current target in include files, Wand suddenly could automate linkage to modules from other projects and gone was all project files.</p>
